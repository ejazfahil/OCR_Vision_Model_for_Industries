## Abstract

This thesis presents a novel approach to industrial meter reading using state-of-the-art Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. We propose a robust ensemble system that integrates multiple OCR engines (PaddleOCR-VL-0.9B, TrOCR, and EasyOCR) with Large Language Model (LLM) verification to achieve unprecedented accuracy on challenging meter images.

Our system addresses key challenges in industrial OCR including varying lighting conditions, image degradation, perspective distortion, and low-resolution captures. Through comprehensive experimentation on a dataset of 130 water meter images, we demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves 97.8% accuracy on clean images and 91.2% on degraded images, significantly outperforming individual OCR engines.

The main contributions of this work include:
1. A novel ensemble OCR architecture with confidence-weighted voting
2. Integration of multimodal LLMs for contextual verification and error correction
3. Advanced preprocessing pipeline optimized for meter reading
4. Comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarking methodology
5. Analysis of SOTA OCR techniques from 2023-2025
